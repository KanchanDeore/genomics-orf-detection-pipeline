# Genomics ORF Detection Pipeline

🎯 **Goal:** This project helps you understand how bioinformaticians find genes hidden inside DNA sequences — using Python!

This project simulates random DNA sequences, scores them for biological motifs (short, meaningful patterns), and then identifies **Open Reading Frames (ORFs)** — the stretches of DNA that potentially encode proteins. All code is beginner-friendly and educational, making this an excellent introduction to genomics pipelines!

## 🧬 What is an ORF and Why Should I Care?

An **Open Reading Frame (ORF)** is a sequence in DNA that starts with a *start codon* and ends with a *stop codon*. These regions often contain genes — the instructions for building proteins.

Finding ORFs is one of the first steps in:
- Understanding genetic makeup 🧬
- Identifying new genes 🔍
- Building tools for drug discovery 💊

## 🛠️ What Does This Project Include?

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `generateRandomSeq.py` | Simulates realistic DNA sequences (like mini-genomes) |
| `Motif and Alignment.py` | Calculates scores for known DNA motifs in the sequences |
| `ORFs.py` | Detects Open Reading Frames from the sequences |
| `Output.py` | Plots and compares motif scores for different organisms |
| `random_sequences.fasta` / `spaceSeq.fa` | Input FASTA files of DNA |
| `Score Distribution.png` | Histogram comparing motif scores (Spacii vs Pathogen) |

## 🧪 How It Works (Step by Step)

1. **DNA Simulation** 🧬  
   We create synthetic DNA sequences that mimic real biological data.

2. **Motif Scoring** 🧩  
   Using scoring matrices, we search for common biological motifs and score them in each sequence.

3. **ORF Detection** 🚀  
   We identify regions that start with `ATG` and end with one of the stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`), ensuring the correct length and frame.

4. **Score Visualization** 📊  
   We compare motif score distributions from two organisms using Python histograms.

## 💡 Ideas for Extension

- Add codon usage bias for improved realism.
- Annotate detected ORFs with gene names.
- Build a web interface for uploading sequences and viewing ORFs online.
